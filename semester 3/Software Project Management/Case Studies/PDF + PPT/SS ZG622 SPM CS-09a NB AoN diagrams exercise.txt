AoN diagram - 
Find the critical path
The longest path in the network above is START-B-C-E-G-END with a duration of 22 weeks. Hence, this path is the critical path



Calculate ES, EF, LS, Float, LF

AoN diagram - 
Find the critical path
Notes: ES/LS and EF/LF include both the first day (or week)  and last day  (week) of an activity.  
As a result Float = LF-(ES-1)-Duration in the above diagram.
